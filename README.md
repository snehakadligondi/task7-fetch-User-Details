# Task 7 â€” Fetch Users from API

This is my internship Task 7 project.  
It fetches user data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays **Name, Email, and Address**.  
It also has a **Reload button** and shows error messages when the API fails.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` with Live Server 
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in the browser.

## Technologies Used
